This is a random forest model generated from the credit card fraud dataset from Kaggle.
The accuracy of the model using all of the features is 100%. After identifying the best features that contribute to classification,
a new random forest model was generated using only the top 5 features. The new random forest model resulted in 100% accuracy as well.
